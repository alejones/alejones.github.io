## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
  
I'm Alex, a software developer focused on applied AI and automation. By day, I build practical solutions that make complex systems work smarter in real-world environments. By night (and many weekends), I'm a swim coach helping kids get faster in the water and become better people out of it.

### What I'm About  

I love getting AI to work in the real-world. I've created solutions that use computer vision systems for package processing, generative AI for training data creation, language models for unstructured text analysis, and data visualization dashboards. I focus on delivering tangible results that address real business challenges rather than theoretical possibilities.

My background is a bit different than most tech folksâ€”I spent several summers working on manufacturing production lines during college (making candy wrappers and dock bumpers), which gave me a unique perspective on industrial challenges. I've also spent time as an Aquatics Director and Head Coach, managing volunteers, staff, and children; all while never losing sight of the mission.

### What you'll find on my blog

It's new! Not much to find yet. Some posts about projects I'm working on, little problems I've solved, and swimming coaching thoughts should all be coming.
