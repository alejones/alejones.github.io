## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
  
I'm Alex, a software developer focused on applied AI and automation. By day, I build practical solutions that make complex systems work smarter in real-world environments. By night (and many weekends), I'm a swim coach helping kids get faster in the water and become better people out of it.

### What I'm About  

I love getting AI to work in the real-world. I've created solutions that use computer vision systems for package processing, generative AI for training data creation, language models for unstructured text analysis, and data visualization dashboards. I focus on delivering tangible results that address real business challenges rather than theoretical possibilities.

My background is a bit different than most tech folksâ€”I spent several summers working on manufacturing production lines during college (making candy wrappers and dock bumpers), which gave me a unique perspective on industrial challenges. I've also spent time as an Aquatics Director and Head Coach, managing volunteers, staff, and children; all while never losing sight of the mission.

### My Technical Side

I'm often putting projects together with the following technologies:

- AI development with Python, Keras, and Transformers
- Containerization with Podman
- Responsive search using Elasticsearch
- Data processing and cleaning with Pandas
- Linux for both homelab, AI training environments, and daily driver OS
- Streamlit for rapid prototyping, demos, and data visualization
- Proxmox, Podman, and Tailscale for homelab infrastructure

### Beyond The Code

My time as a swim coach and Aquatics Director shaped me in ways that technical work alone couldn't. I learned to break down complex skills into teachable components, adapt instruction for different learning styles, and give feedback that motivates rather than discourages. Managing aquatics operations taught me how to prioritize safety while balancing competing needs, coordinate logistics for large events, and make quick decisions when unexpected situations arise. Most importantly, I developed patience and empathy that help me understand what users and teammates actually need, not just what they initially ask for.

Meanwhile, constantly testing new technology through my homelab and side projects has made me adaptable and resourceful - skills that translate well to solving unexpected problems in production environments.

When I'm not coding or coaching, you'll find me tinkering with my homelab setup, experimenting with new technologies, or enjoying the outdoors around Seattle.  

I believe in building things that matter, working closely with people to understand their needs, and creating solutions that are both elegant and practical.
